			⚠️ Important: After installing the DeckFX, make sure to visit DawgVinci's discord to grab the
			'DeckFX Fix' file. This step is essential to avoid any gameplay issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don't have the DeckFX fix yet, you might notice your trucks get 'stuck' when doing
			manuals and grinds. This may negatively impact your gaming experience by causing issues with
			turning mechanics.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is because the DeckFX and XXL3 mods overlap each other, affecting the 'Loose Trucks'
			feature in DeckFX.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Deck FX Fix Example (stuck)</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			To fix this, head to DawgVinci's Discord and grab the 'DeckFX Fix' file from the #xxlmod
			section. You will need to scroll up to find the DeckFX Fix for v1.2.
		</p>
		<p>Download and extract the file, then place the DeckFX.dll file here:</p>
		<p>SkaterXL/Mods/DeckFX</p>
		<p>
			Click 'replace.' This will ensure the DeckFX mod works as intended, allowing for a seamless
			skateboarding experience.

		<h2 id="howtouse">How to Use the Deck FX Mod</h2>
		<p>
			Once installed, the Deck FX Mod can be accessed in-game by pressing F3. Use the sliders to
			adjust various aspects of your skateboard to suit your preferences.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note for Laptop Users:</strong> If you are using a laptop and have trouble opening the
			mod with the F3 key, you might need to enable your function keys. This is often done by pressing
			the Fn key along with the respective function key (e.g., Fn + F3).
